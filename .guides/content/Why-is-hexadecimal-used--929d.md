The CPU of a computer cannot understand hexadecimal and never, ever uses it.

Hexadecimal notation is used to help humans cope with long strings of binary digits â€“ they are much shorter in hexadecimal.

Examples of their use include:

- Representing 24 bit colour codes.
- MAC addresses re given in hexadecimal form.
- When  computer malfunctions, error code numbers are usually given in hexadecimal.
- Hexadecimal is also used to represent numerical values in assembly language.

Hexadecimal is used for human convenience, NOT for the computer.
