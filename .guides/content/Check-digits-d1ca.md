The most common errors are transcription errors, which occur when humans are entering precise data into a computer system. A user may have lists of numbers such as bank account or credit card numbers that they have to enter, but of course humans are prone to making mistakes.

Using a check digit can indicate if an account number that has been entered cannot exist but it cannot say if it is the correct account number for the person concerned.

A common method is to use a modulus check digit and the most used variety is the **modulus 11** check digit, which does a calculation on the digits and the total it finds must be exactly divisible by 11 with no remainder.
