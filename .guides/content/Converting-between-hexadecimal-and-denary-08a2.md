**Hexadecimal to denary**

Hexadecimal can be converted to denary in the same way as binary- using the place values.

Therefore the hexadecimal number CA is equal to (C*16) + (A * 1) 
As C = 12 and A = 10 the result is (12 * 16) + (10 * 1) = 192 + 10 = **202**

**Denary to hexadecimal**

To convert to hexadecimal we must progressively divide by 16 until the result is 0 and remember the remainders.

Therefore 239 in denary is equal to **EF** in hexadecimal.

**Notice how the second remainder is the first of the hexadecimal digits.**
